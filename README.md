# Grotto Bestiary

This website is inspired by [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/). I wanted to make something similar for Grotto Beasts cards
and this is the result. It started out as a simple card search with a single page, but I added on many more features over
time. The site now has [accounts](https://www.grotto-bestiary.com/account),
[an inventory manager](https://www.grotto-bestiary.com/inventory),
[trade searching](https://www.grotto-bestiary.com/trades), and more! A appreciate everyone who uses the site and I hope you
enjoy it! A special thanks to the following people, who helped with the original card scanning efforts:

- Jeff
- Paul
- ConvoBreaker
- DreamyTracker
- Cylosis
- SpookyBoogie
- godofgubgub
- quirky.
- TheDangerDog
- randomCaribou

And an extra special thanks to Nick, who created the original
[photoshop design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1loyNEtfEnRf5sGdIxAu3QslEmUNn2gTD/view?usp=sharing) for the card template
used on the [card creator](https://www.grotto-bestiary.com/create)
